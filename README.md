## Generative Adversarial Network

A simple implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network in Tensorflow (Keras) to have in my code snippets. 
Trained on Mist dataset, it can be re-adapted to work with everything.

**NOTE**: At the moment (april 2021) it doesn't work with the Apple fork of Tensorflow (alpha 3)
